# üöÄ The Production-Grade RAG System
# High-Accuracy Multimodal Intelligence Powered by Gemini

**The challenge:** Traditional RAG systems are slow, brittle, and struggle with complex data and multimodal queries.
**The solution:** A **high-accuracy, production-ready** Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system built on **Gemini 2.0 Flash**. We've engineered every layer‚Äîfrom indexing to final response‚Äîfor performance, context, and unparalleled accuracy.

## ‚ú® Why This RAG System is Different

| Feature | The Problem It Solves | Impact |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Multimodal Intelligence** | Ignores context in charts, diagrams, and images. | **Understands everything:** Analyzes images, charts, and text in a single workflow. |
| **Cross-Encoder Reranking** | Traditional search returns relevant, but not *most* relevant, results. | **Guaranteed Accuracy:** Boosts final relevance by 10-15% over standard vector search. |
| **Semantic Chunking** | Fixed chunking breaks sentences and destroys context. | **Context Preservation:** Intelligently splits text at sentence boundaries for maximum coherence. |
| **Intent-Aware Retrieval** | Treats all queries the same, leading to poor results. | **Smarter Strategy:** Adapts the retrieval process based on 6 query categories (e.g., *Visual Query*, *Comparative Analysis*). |
| **Conversation Memory** | Can't answer follow-up questions without restarting the context. | **Natural Dialogue:** Remembers up to 5 turns of conversation history for fluid interactions. |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Core Architecture: The Agent Workflow

Our system orchestrates a chain of specialized **Agents** to handle the query from classification to final, cited answer.

1.  **Intent Agent:** **Classifies** the user query (e.g., FACT\_LOOKUP, VISUAL\_QUERY) to set the optimal path.
2.  **Retrieval Agent:** Executes **FAISS Search** then applies **Cross-Encoder Reranking** to pull the most relevant text chunks.
3.  **Vision Agent (If needed):** Performs detailed **image and chart analysis** using Gemini Vision to extract visual context.
4.  **Reasoning Agent:** The **Gemini 2.0 Flash** brain. It synthesizes all context (text, vision, memory) into a single, comprehensive, and **cited** response.
5.  **Memory Manager:** Updates the conversation history ($MAX\_MEMORY\_TURNS$) for contextual follow-ups.
